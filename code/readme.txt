1.3D Count: This folder contains code for performing the counting of three-dimensional objects. It is particularly suited for processing and analyzing objects in three-dimensional spaces, such as in medical imaging or spatial analysis.

2.BoundingBoxSplitter.py: The purpose of this script is to separate the originally generated detection results (typically in txt format) according to their source files. This is done to clearly demonstrate the effects of 3D counting in supplementary figures for a paper, making it easier for readers to understand the origin and characteristics of each detected object.

3.DrawBoxes.py: This script draws bounding boxes on images based on the data from txt files, displaying the detection results. This approach visually demonstrates the areas recognized by the algorithm as objects or features of interest.

4.Segmenter.py: This script uses npy files generated from segmentation and corresponding images to display segmentation results. It distinguishes different parts of an image, facilitating further analysis or detailed segmentation display in academic papers.
